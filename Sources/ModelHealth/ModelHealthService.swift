/// The primary interface for ModelHealth's movement analysis platform.
///
/// ModelHealthService enables you to measure and analyze human movement from smartphone
/// videos. It provides a complete workflow for:
/// - Authentication and session management
/// - Multi-camera calibration
/// - Movement data collection
/// - Analysis and reporting
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The SDK follows a structured workflow:
///
/// 1. **Initialization**: Create a service with your API key
/// 2. **Session Creation**: Create a calibration session
/// 3. **Camera Calibration**: Calibrate cameras using a checkerboard pattern
/// 4. **Neutral Pose**: Capture subject's neutral standing pose for scaling
/// 5. **Recording**: Record movement activities (squats, jumps, etc.)
/// 6. **Analysis**: Fetch processed biomechanical data
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let service = try ModelHealthService(apiKey: "your-api-key")
///
/// // Create session and calibrate
/// let session = try await service.createSession()
/// let details = CheckerboardDetails(rows: 4, columns: 5, squareSize: 35, placement: .perpendicular)
/// try await service.calibrateCamera(session, checkerboardDetails: details) { status in }
///
/// // Capture neutral pose
/// try await service.calibrateNeutralPose(for: subject, in: session) { status in }
///
/// // Record a movement activity
/// let activity = try await service.record(activityNamed: "cmj-1", in: session)
/// // Subject performs movement...
/// try await service.stopRecording(session)
///
/// // Poll for processing completion, then analyze
/// let status = try await service.getStatus(forActivity: activity)
/// if case .ready = status {
///     let task = try await service.startAnalysis(.counterMovementJump, for: activity, in: session)
///     // Poll for analysis completion...
/// }
/// ```
